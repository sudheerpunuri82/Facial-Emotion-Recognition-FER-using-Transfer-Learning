FER is an challenging taks and has high potential. Till 2019, research was very rigorous using hand crafted methods, shallow methods other techniques to classify facial emotions. Few of them are DWT, HAAR etc. , The emerge of Deep Learning was the era where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were used mainly for feature extraction and classification.
